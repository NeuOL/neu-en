                    <h1>Key Laboratory</h1>
					<div id="collegeIntro">
						<h2 style="text-align:center; padding-top:10px;">The State Key Lab of Rolling and Automation</h2>
						  <div id="detail">

							  <div>
								  <p>Under the financial support of the World Bank, the state key lab of rolling and automation (abbr. RAL), formerly the laboratory of steel rolling founded in 1950s, is established and became the only state key laboratory in rolling and automation technology in 1995. Entering the 21st century, RAL accelerates the pace of development, enlarges the scale, raises the research quality and proceeds to become the national team in its scientific research field.</p>
								  <p>RAL has its own characteristics in teaching and scientific research, i.e. teamwork, innovation, practice and striving for excellence. By taking on the national, local and industrial major projects, RAL has cultivated a large number of scientific researchers and high-level professionals. Extensive domestic and international academic exchanges are being carried out every year. RAL people have found their own position among their peers and left an impression of sincere, friendly, practical and competence.</p>
								  <p>According to the national strategic target in steel industry, RAL has determined its new research directions, which include ①the production of high quality, low-cost metallic materials; ②simulation, prediction and control of microstructure-properties evolution during processing; ③comprehensive automation control of metal forming; ④advanced manufacturing technology and high-performance materials.</p>

								  <p>RAL has paid much attention to the establishment of a structurally reasonable, highly motivated and high-level scientific research team. Right now, RAL has 55 faculty members, including 15 professors (12 of them are Ph.D supervisors), 10 associate professors, 4 post-doctoral researchers. In addition, there are 147 Ph.D students and 114 Master students. Prof. Wang Guodong, the academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, is the academic leader of RAL. Prof. Wu Di is now the director of RAL.</p>
								  <p>RAL has a space of 7000 square meters for offices and experimental facilities, which have facilitated the establishment of three research platforms, i.e. simulation of steel forming, characterization and analysis of microstructure-properties, process control and adjustment. There are 12 characteristic rolling equipments, including hot-rolling mill for strip and plate, 2/4 high cold-rolling mill, roll piercing mill for seamless steel tube and twin-roll casting machine. Other experimental equipments for materials characterization and mechanical tests, such as thermo-mechanical simulator, SEM, TEM, tensile test machine are also available in RAL for high quality research work.
								  </p>
								  <p>The operating mechanism in RAL is "open, exchange, unite and competition". In order to attract the talented researchers, RAL has established the open project program, visiting scholar plan and joint research group with domestic or international companies and research institutes. Each year, a number of internationally well-known scientists are invited to RAL to give lectures. At the same time, young researchers are sent abroad to do collaborative researches and attend international conferences. Especially, RAL has close relations to the steel industry in China. Professors are often invited to steel companies to give scientific and technological lectures, and collaborating with engineers to solve practical problems. Theories have linked well to the practice in industry, and finally became productive forces.</p>

								  <p>Recent years, RAL has taken on a number of national projects, such as 863, 973, national natural science fund and national key technologies R&amp;D projects et al. Meanwhile, RAL received five national awards for science and technology progress, one for technological invention and 36 provincial/ministry level awards for science and technology progress. More than 900 papers and 30 books have been published. More than 20 patents for invention, 10 patents for utility model are under application. 31 patents have been granted. During the recent years, the landmark research achievements include:</p>
								  <p>1)Development of super steel and its industrialization: It has been financed by national 973 and 863 projects. Based on the investigation on microstructure-properties evolution during hot rolling and strengthening mechanism, thermal-mechanical simulation tests, experimental hot rolling tests and industrial trials, the 400-500MPa super steel has been developed and the strength of the plain carbon steel has been doubled. This research work won several awards, such as the national award for science and technology progress (first class). More than four million tons of super steels have been produced up to the year of 2005.
								  </p>
								  <p>2)Key rolling technology and equipments in hot rolling of plate: This research has been financed by major technology and equipment development project from NDRC (national development and reform commission). Based on the reformation project of 3500mm plate mill in Shougang Group, serials of key technologies with independent intellectual property rights have been developed. Integration of plate rolling technology and major equipment, and integrative innovation have been realized. This research work won several awards, such as the national award for science and technology progress (second class). The achievements from this work have been applied to more than 10 domestic and abroad medium-thick plate mills. </p>
								  <p>3)Development of serials of experimental equipments: taking advantages of interdisciplinary researches, RAL has developed serials of experimental equipments, including thermal-mechanical simulator, experimental hot rolling mill and cold rolling mill, controlled cooling equipment, continuous annealing simulator et al. Those equipments have already been used in the technology centre in BaoSteel, Jinan Steel, Jiuquan Steel and AnSteel et al. </p>

		   　　　<p>4)Intelligent rolling technology and its application: this research has been initiated from practical need in large-scale steel companies in China such as Baosteel. It started from improving the software for hot-rolling process control. Based on the rigid-plastic finite element method, prediction of microstructure-properties evolution and the artificial intelligent technology, the tools for the development of mathematical model and optimization of model parameters for continuous rolling process have been developed. The optimized rolling process has facilitated the improvement of product quality and productivity. This research work won several awards, such as the national award for science and technology progress (second class). The achievements from this work have been applied to several steel companies.</p>
		   　　
		   <p>RAL now gains more and more attention from its peers, and became a quite active and influential team, making great contributions to the development of rolling technology and steel industry in China. Domestic as well as international researchers are welcome to visit RAL!</p>
