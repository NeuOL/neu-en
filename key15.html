						  <div>
                              <p>Ever since its foundation, the Key Laboratory of microfluidic and flow injection analysis (MFIA) of Liaoning Province has undertaken a series of scientific projects, including one Major Program of NSFC (sub-project), one Major Fund for International Cooperation and Exchange of NSFC, three Key Programs of NSFC, one National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars, one National Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars, more than ten General Programs of NSFC and International Cooperation Programs, in addition to one sub-project of 973 Program and several cooperation projects with companies. It has published more than one hundred academic papers on a series of international journals including Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., Anal. Chem., Lab Chip, Chem. Eur. J. et.al, with more than thousands of citation rates. Meanwhile, it published 2 academic monographs, participated in the publication of 4 other academic monographs, and was authorized several national invention patents. The Key Laboratory of MFIA has been awarded the first prize in natural science of Liaoning Province and the first prize in natural science of the Ministry of Education in 2001 and 2007, respectively.</p>
                              <p>The Key Laboratory of MFIA works closely with and has extensive exchange programs with international academic and educational organizations as well as instrumental companies including University of Texas at Arlington, Gunma University, Hitachi High Technologies, Moscow State University and the University of Balearic Islands.</p>
                              <p>Currently, the Key Laboratory of MFIA has nine faculty members, including seven professors, one associate professor and one assistant professor. Among them, one professor was awarded the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars, one professor was awarded the National Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars, three were awarded with the 21st Century Talent Fund by the MOE. It has more than 70 MSc and Ph.D. students.</p>
                              <p>The Key Laboratory of MFIA now focuses its research interests on microfluidic analysis systems, flow injection analysis and related coupling techniques, novel sample pretreatment technique, spectral analysis, nanotechnology and bio-analytical chemistry.</p>
