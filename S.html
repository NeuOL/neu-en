                       <p>The College of Sciences, originating from the former Department of Sciences of NEU in 1929, was established in September 1994. At present the college has eight basic units including Department of Mathematics, Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry, Institute of Molecular Science and Engineering, Research Center for Analytical Sciences, Institute of Applied Mechanics, Institute of Materials Physics &amp; Chemistry and Institute of Systems Science. Currently, there are more than 240 faculty members in the college, including 46 professors and 68 associate professors. Among which there are 1 "973" project chief scientist (military), 1 PI for the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars and 8 New Century Excellent Talents supported by the Ministry of Education.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The College of Sciences is made up of 8 first-class disciplines and 38 second-class disciplines. Chemistry, Physics, Mechanics, Statistics, Physics and Chemistry of Materials offer PhD programs, and the other disciplines offer Master programs. Materials Physics and Chemistry is the National Key Discipline, while Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Applied Mathematics and Condensed Mater Physics are Liao-Ning Provincial Key Disciplines. Two Liao-Ning Provincial Key Laboratories have been developed, including Liaoing Liquid Crystal Polymer Science and Engineering Laboratory, and Key Laboratory for Flow Analysis and Related Instruments, Liaoning Province.

                       <p>
                           	During the last few years, 1 National Technological Invention Award (second-level) , 2 Natural Science Awards from the Ministry of Education (first-level), 2 Provincial Natural Science Awards (first-level) and 1 Provincial Technological Invention Award (first-level) have been awarded to the faculty members of the College of Sciences. The faculty members have been responsible for more than 260 research projects which include one "973" project (military), more than 70 projects granted by National Natural Science Foundation, covering 1 National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, 1 Major International Joint Research Project, and 2 Key Projects. More than 2000 high quality research papers have been published, and the majority of them were indexed by SCI. Many of the papers are published in journals with impact factors of more than 5. Among the various papers, one has so far been cited for more than 800 times in SCI journals. Up to now, the College of Sciences has established 1 National Excellent Course, 1 National Bilingual Demonstration Course, 6 Provincial Excellent Courses, 1 Provincial Teaching Team, 2 Provincial Master Textbooks, and 3 Provincial Experiment Teaching Demonstration Centers. In addition, our faculty has also received 1 Provincial Teaching Master Award.

                        The College of Sciences has an enrollment of more than 1600 degree candidates including over 400 graduate students and more than 1200 undergraduate students. It is noticeable that during the recent years 45% of our undergraduates have registered as graduate students at various Universities and Institutes all over the world. The abilities of innovation and research for the students have been significantly improved, as demonstrated by 3 National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award nomination, and the publications of a large number of excellent papers by our graduate students.</p>
