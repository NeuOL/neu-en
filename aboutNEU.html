                    <h1>About NEU</h1>
                    <div>
                    <p>Northeastern University (NEU) is one of the national key universities under the direct administration of the Ministry of Education. It is situated in Shenyang, the central city of Northeastern China, covering an area of 2,530,000 square meters, in which the construction area amounts to 1,370,000 square meters. </p>
                    
                    <p>Founded in April 1923, NEU is one of the prestigious universities in China, boasting its rich cultural deposit and glorious patriotic tradition. General Zhang Xueliang (or Chang Hsueh-liang) was the honorary president from August 1928 to January 1937. NEU is designated as the national key university of the “211 Project” and “985 Project”, jointly run by the Ministry of Education, Liaoning Province and Shenyang City. In its history of more than 90 years, by keeping pace with the national development and rejuvenation, NEU has been following its motto of “seeking unremitting self-improvement, and integrating knowledge and action”. </p>

                    <p>Before the establishment of new China, the NEU faculty and students had been the main force and vanguard of the December 9th Movement. During the earlier period of China’s development, the university started many new eras in China: the first analogue computer, the first CT made in China, and the first piece of super steel. It has also gained a number of high-leveled scientific research achievements, including the new technology of smelting vanadium titanium magnetite, the energy-saving theory and technology of steel industry, the controlled rolling and controlled cooling technique, and the mixed intelligent optimization control technology. By establishing the first university science park in China, NEU has established a series of high-tech enterprises such as NEU Software Group and NEU Net Group, forming its unique characteristics in technology innovation, technology transfer, and university-industry cooperation. </p>

                    <p>NEU has 66 undergraduate programs, 15 of which are national characteristic specialties. 189 programs are entitled to the conferment of master’s degrees (with another 10 professional degree conferring entitlements) and 108 programs are entitled to the conferment of doctoral degrees. In addition, it has 17 post-doctoral research stations. NEU has 3 national key primary disciplines, 4 national key secondary disciplines and 1 national key (cultivating) discipline, which cover 16 secondary disciplines in total. </p> 

                    <p>NEU has a total of 2,655 faculty members, including 528 professors.

D students, 7,073 graduate students, and 29,248 undergraduate students on campus. By now, 260,000 alumni have gained wide acceptance for their diligence and innovative achievements. </p> 

                    <p>As a university with multiple disciplines, NEU boasts of its sound structure, reasonable layout, and distinctive characteristics in discipline distribution. While supporting the development of its strong disciplines, NEU is also developing the newly-rising disciplines and the disciplines of humanities and social sciences. New clusters of preponderant disciplines, which are designed for basic industries (e.g. metallurgy, materials, machinery, mining) and strategic emerging industries (e.g. automation, computer, biomedical engineering), are developing alongside with the disciplines of humanities and social sciences (e.g. Philosophy of science and technology, management, administration). </p>

                    <p>With the fundamental goal of developing and cultivating students’ high morality, NEU has accomplished great achievements in top-notch innovative talents cultivation, teaching theory renovation, teaching method research, and cultivation model development. During the 12th five-year-plan, NEU has won 3 National Teaching Achievement Awards and initiated 10 National Open Courses of Excellence as well as 15 National Shared Courses of Excellence. In addition, 18 textbooks have been approved during the 12th five-year-plan period and 5 doctoral dissertations have been nominated as nationally excellent dissertations. In addition to establishing 29 startup businesses, students have won 305 international awards of innovation and entrepreneurship, 1,306 national awards, 1,535 innovation and entrepreneurship awards of excellence, and nearly 300 patents. The quality of student matriculation as well as the employment rate and quality of the graduates’ employment remain high. </p>

                    <p>NEU adheres to the research goal of serving for the national strategic and regional development; meanwhile, it encourages free exploration and promotes collaborative innovation. The level of basic research is increasing steadily and the competitiveness of technological innovation is being enhanced. Since the implementation of “Twelfth five-year” plan, NEU has undertaken 5,126 projects in science and technology, and obtained 230 rewards on science and technology, among which there are 14 state-level awards and 44 first prizes at the provincial or ministerial level.

There are 3 key state-level laboratories, 4 national engineering (technology) research centers, 3 national engineering laboratories, and 3 innovation groups of National Natural Science Foundation. There are 2 state-level collaborative innovation centers and 3 collaborative innovation centers of Liaoning Province. </p>

                    <p>With the focus on the new IT technology, new materials, bio-science, and other edge-cutting fields, NEU established Cloud Computing Science and Technology Industrial Park, New Materials Industrial Park, and Health Industrial Park. It greatly promoted the rapid development of cloud computing and big data industry, improved the innovation and upgrading of equipment manufacturing industry in Shenyang, and laid an important new foundation for NEU, giving impetus to national economic construction development and the second-time revitalization of the old industrial base of Northeastern China. </p>
