								 <p>The Ministry-of-education (MOE) key laboratory for eco-metallurgy of complex ores (EMCO) in Northeastern University is established from the primary discipline of metallurgical engineering (a national key discipline, including 3 sub-disciplines of ferrous metallurgy, non-ferrous metallurgy, and physical chemistry of metallurgical), the sub-disciplines of mineral processing engineering (a candidate of national key sub-discipline) and environmental science and industrial ecology (two key sub-disciplines of Liaoning province), by combining the Liaoning provincial key laboratory of special steels metallurgy, Liaoning college key laboratory of modern metallurgical technology and Liaoning provincial key laboratory for boron resources eco-utilization and boron minerals. EMCO started its test running in 2008 after the contruction proposal was approved by MOE.
		   </p><p>According to the "Interim Procedures of College Key Laboratory Construction and Management" of MOE and considering the specific situations of the laboratory, EMCO has implemented a series of management regulations with the characteristics of open, flexibility, cooperation and competition. Following the principle of simultaneous implementations of construction, research, open, and development, significant progress has been achieved in discipline and team construction, education, scientific research and international exchange and cooperation. The overall teaching and scientific research of the laboratory have stepped to a higher level.
		   </p><p>Aiming at the frontier of international science and technology research and development and the national strategic demands, EMCO has concentrated on the frontier fundamental studies and the strategic high technology research in the area of eco-metallurgy of complex ores, and thereby some new theories, methods, and technologies and processes have been developed.
		   </p><p>The development aim of EMCO is that, combining the education of high quality talents and the constructions of science and technology innovation base and team, the laboratory shall be developed into a key base for high level talents education with excellent scientists in the area of complex ores eco-metallurgy, and a internationally recognized research and development center with the features of open and cross disciplines. EMCO will then play a supporting role in the science and technology progress of complex ores eco-metallurgy, as well as in the revitalization of traditional industries of northeast China.
		   </p><p>The main research interests of the laboratory include:
		   </p><p>1)Theories and technologies for separation and extraction of complex ores
		   </p><p>2)Theories and critical technologies for ecological metallurgy
		   </p><p>3)New technologies for development and utilization of high-quality metallurgical products from complex ores</p>
		   <p>In the past three years, EMCO has undertaken 280 research projects supported by national supporting science and technology program, national key basic research and development program (973 program), national high technology research and development program (863 program), national natural science foundation of China, various ministry and provincial science and technology foundations, as well as related industries. It has won 27 national and provincial awards for science and technology, applied for 45 national invention patents, published 12 academic monographs and more than 780 academic papers.</p>
		   <p>All the construction works of key laboratory specified by MOE have been fully completed, and EMCO will apply for the acceptance appraisal from MOE.</p>
		   <p>The director of EMCO during the period of laboratory construction is professor Jiang Maofa.</p>
