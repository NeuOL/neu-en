                       <p>
School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation was founded in 1993, which was developed on the base of the original Department of Mechanical Engineering of NEU. It is a teaching and research institution involving cultivating students, scientific research, and technological development.                       </p>
                       <p>
At present, there are 2 first-level disciplines in the school which are Mechanical Engineering, and Power Engineering and Engineering Thermophysics. Under the two first-level disciplines there are 7 second-level disciplines, all of which have the awarding rights of doctoral and master's degrees and postdoctoral mobile research stations. Among all disciplines, Mechanical Design and Theory is National Key Discipline, and Mechanical Engineering, one of the first-level disciplines, and Fluid Machinery and Engineering, one of the second-level disciplines are Provincial Key Disciplines.                       </p>
                       <p>
In the school, there are 4 undergraduate majors: Mechanical engineering and automation, Vehicle engineering, Industrial design and Process equipment and control engineering.                       </p>
                       <p>
The school consists of 14 grass-roots academic organizations: Institute of Advanced Manufacturing and Automation Technology, Institute of Mechanical Design and Theory, Center of Mechanical Reliability and Dynamics Research, Institute of Modern Design and Analysis, Institute of Mechatronic Engineering, Institute of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Technology, Institute of Vehicle Engineering, Institute of Industrial Design, the Vacuum and Fluid Engineering Research Center, Institute of Process Equipment and Environmental Engineering, Institute of Power Machinery and Mining Equipment, Institute of Modern Transmission and Digital Technology(Mechanical basis teaching and research center), Center of Engineering Graphics Teaching and Research, Experimental Center; School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation now has National Mechanical Elementary Courses' Teaching Base, and other teaching bases of Liaoning Key Laboratory of Major Mechanical Equipments Dynamics Reliability and Quality Engineering , Liaoning Key Laboratory of High-end CNC Machine Tools, Liaoning Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing and the Automation Technology, Liaoning Province CAD / CAM Engineering Technology Center, Liaoning Province Mechanical Product Design Center, Liaoning Province Equipment Diagnosis and Monitoring Engineering Center, Liaoning Province Digital Design and Manufacturing Technology Research Center, Liaoning Province Elementary Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center of Mechanical Engineering, NEU branch center of national technique center in Shenyang Blower Works Group Co., Ltd. ,NEU branch center of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Group Co., Ltd., etc.                       </p>
                       <p>
The school has a team of high quality teaching and research, and has a group of outstanding academic leaders. It now has 208 faculty members, including 1 academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences , 1 member of Discipline Counseling Team of the State Council Academic Degrees Committee, 1 member of Mechanical Discipline Assessment Team of National Natural Science Foundation Committee, 1 Special Professor of Cheung Kong Scholars, 3 members of National Board for Professional Teaching Steering Committee and the National Basic Course Teaching Steering Committee, 7 'New Century Talent' of the Ministry of Education, 21 doctoral supervisors, 63 associate professors, and 10 senior lab technicians. There are 3353 students at school, among whom there are 303 doctoral candidates,1054 Master Degree candidates.                       </p>
                       <p>
In recent years, with the efforts of all the staff, the school achieves abundant accomplishments, and completes many scientific researches, technological breakthroughs and engineering projects, having won a number of national, provincial and ministerial prizes. The research achievements have reached the advanced international standard in the fields of Using and Control of Vibration Engineering, Modern Design Theory and Methods, Mechanical Dynamic Design, Mechanical Reliability Design, Mechanical Structure Fatigue Strength and Life Prediction, and Intelligent Machines and the Control of Them, Ultra-High-Speed Grinding Technology, Parallel Robot and Parallel Machine Tools, Digital Design and Manufacture, Functional Film Material and Molecular Gas Dynamics, Vehicle CAN Bus Control Technology, Hydraulic and Pneumatic Technology. In the recent 5 years, our school have undertaken more than 200 projects, including Major Projects of National Natural Science Foundation, Key Projects, the General Projects, the National "973" Project, the National "863" Plan, and the National Major Research Topics and Projects as well. The school has won 37 national, provincial and ministerial Science and Technology Progress Award and has released more than 2000 academic papers on important domestic and foreign academic journals.                       </p>
                       <p>
The school attaches much importance to academic exchange, we have already established the relationship of communication in terms of academy, scientific research and talents training with more than 10 universities and research institutions of America, Britain, Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Korea, Finland, etc. A number of experts and scholars are invited to be part-time professors, and many scholars of our school are sent out for academic communication and cooperation in scientific researches.                       </p>
                       <p>
The student work of our school is based on the educational idea of "Student-Oriented, Service First", it takes patriotism education as the core, and takes science and technology innovation as the goal, takes Employment education as the guidance. Through a variety of practical activities, we educate and guide our students' world, life and moral values to cultivate versatile talents with strong personality, competitiveness and votive forces. For many years, our school's students have been welcomed and praised by society and employers and the employment rate has ranked number one in the university for many years. The rate of undergraduates who obtain the qualification to recommend them to postgraduates without examination and successive master-doctor program increases year by year,, and the  rate of underguaduates passing entrance examination for postgraduate programs reaches to over 30 percent for many years.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                       The school will follow the university's general development plan, and take advantage of mechanical engineering, power engineering and engineering thermophysics, promoting our academic standards and improve the education quality to cultivate excellent talents. In addition, we will communicate with large-scale enterprises frequently to extend our ways of employment and teaching. We are all striving to make our school a domestic first-class institute and world-influenced modern school.
