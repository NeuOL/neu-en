                    <h1>Brief Introduction on Northeastern University Board of Trustees</h1>
                    <div>
                    <p>During Peter H. L. Chang’s term as the president of Northeastern University, under the suggestion of the then acting president Ning Encheng, Northeastern University Board of Trustees, referred to as the University Committee, was first set up in China in March, 1931. </p>
                    <p>In 1993 when Northeastern University restored its name, NEU proposed the re-establishment of the Board of Trustees. In June 1996, with the government permission, Northeastern University Board of Trustees was formally established and the old president Peter H. L. Chang was appointed as the honorary chairman.</p>
                    <p>Northeastern University Board of Trustees is an important organization, serving as a platform for the implementation of scientific decision-making, democratic supervision and social participation so as to serve the needs of the reform and development of higher education at Northeastern University. It is also the institution for relevant representatives to get involved in the university development by participating in consultation, deliberation and oversight.</p>
                    <p>The second and third change of terms of the Board of Trustee was carried out respectively in September 2003 and September 2013. Gan Yong, academician and Deputy Director of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, is the incumbent chairman of the third term with 87 members. Mr. Ma Peihua, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, has been appointed the Honorary Chairman of the third term.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, attaching great importance to the roles played by people from all walks of life both at home and abroad, Northeastern University Board of Trustees has encouraged the alumni to participate in the consultation or deliberation on important decision-making such as the university's development goal, strategic planning, discipline construction, professional setting and major reform measures. In order to achieve the goal of becoming a well-known and top level international research university in the new industrialization process of China, the trustees actively carry out cooperation between  the university, society and enterprises, collaborative innovation and other social services to raise funds and integrate social resources for the improvement of university conditions and performance.</p>
