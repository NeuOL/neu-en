                <h2 style="text-align:center; padding-top:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Special Steel Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education on Advanced Metallurgical Process and Equipment</h2>
                <div id="detail">
                    <div>
                        <p>The research center was founded in 2006. It is based on steel metallurgical discipline resources, technology, talents, achievements and technological advantages of industrialization engineering; The achievements of advanced special steel metallurgical technology and equipment of important economic value have been studied mainly to solve the problem of high technology steel materials that restricts our national economy sustainable development and national security strategy. It meets the needs of important engineering, equipment construction and many national economy areas for the special steel materials. The main research directions are shown below:<br />
                        (1) Key special steel material and production process technology for major engineering and equipment;<br />
                        (2) Key technology of resource-saving special steel’s variety development and production;<br />
                        (3) Advanced metallurgical technology development of special steel;<br />
                        (4) Advanced metallurgical automation technology development of equipment of the special steel;<br />
                        Development of complete sets of production lines of the technology centre of steel enterprise pilot plant</p>
                        <p>The center has the basic housing which is for research and validation of the single project and the supporting public facilities that include environmental protection, fire control, labor safety facilities. Among them the housing construction area in the university is 3086 m2, which include the thermal simulation platform workshop area (668 m2), the office and testing equipment (2418 m2). It already has expectations of research development and engineering verification ability, built special steel metallurgical thermal simulation platform and complete testing equipment system. Laboratory equipment is already in place and works normally. Documents, drawings, materials and the file are complete. According to relevant state financial system, we perform the financial statements and it has clear accounts, complete formalities, perfect management. It has formed the integrated operation system from the laboratory test, the bigger test, even to industrialized mass production and has the service ability for special steel production process development and large equipment manufacturing of major projects.</p>
                        <p>The total number of Center at present has more than 70 people (including fixed staff that has more than 50 people) and the personnel scale and structure is reasonable. It establishes talent incentive mechanism and flow system. The main person in charge have the entrepreneurial spirit and management ability. It establishes the supporting management system and operational mechanism that adapts to the development of the center and it also has perfect management system and the organization.</p>
                        <p>The three main research directions of the Center include high quality special steel production technology, special steel smelting refining agent and study of refractory materials, and special steel metallurgical equipment development and manufacturing. In the construction period, through the achievement industrialization, a special steel demonstration base for metallurgical equipment research and development, design and manufacture of the industrialization of engineering has been built in Shenyang; 2 special steel demonstration production lines for smelting and refractory with refining agent has been built in Xinmin of Shenyang. Through the cooperation and technical reform with domestic correlation special steel enterprise for  combining with the existing production lines and the construction of the new production line, a number of high quality special steel production model lines have formed.</p>
                        <p>The Center has more than 14 items of provincial scientific and technical prizes; it has undertaken 75 research items that include National 863 project, enterprise researches etc. The research fund accumulation amounts to 20.96 million yuan; it has applied for 14 items of the national patent of invention and achieved 8 empowered items. The self-developed facilities, such as kinds of electroslag furnace, vacuum furnace and multi-function refining furnace, have been applied in 30 steel enterprises and obtained the remarkable economic and social benefits, which promotes the technology progress of the special steel industry.</p>
                        <p>The Center has become an important force of technology innovation system of the Northeast University that promotes the cultivation of talents and disciplines construction. It establishes the cooperation system in research and production with many of China's steel enterprises and provide good technical consulting and personnel training.</p>
                        <p>The Center can realize benign cycle of economy, the strategic goal is clear, recent engineering task is in implementation clearly.</p>
