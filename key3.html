								  <p>The Key Laboratory for Anisotropy and Texture of Materials (ATM) was authorized to establish in December, 2005 and approved in May, 2008 by Ministry of Education. The ATM is governed by Northeastern University, which is established based on the second class national key discipline of materials science and supported by "985" and "211" national projects in Northeastern University. The director of ATM is Prof. Liang ZUO. The chair of the Academic Committee of the ATM is Prof.  Ke LU, the Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
		   　　　
		   <p>The goal of the ATM is to build up a high-level laboratory in materials science community, meet the national and local needs, focusing on the frontier problems in materials science. The laborary is featured by the characterization, design, control of anisotropy and texture of materials, and the preparation of advanced materials. There are four key research fields, including (1) the characterization technique of material texture and anisotropy, (2) the texture and microstructure control of advanced materials, (3) the design and preparation of anisotropic structural materials, (4) the design and preparation of anisotropic functional materials. These reseaches cover the frontier issues and key technologies in the field of anisotropy and texture of materials.</p>
		   　　　
		   <p>There are 30 staffs in the lab now, including 12 professors (10 doctor supervisors) and 11 associate professors. Among whom 3 staffs are the obtainers of National Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars, 2 staffs are admitted to National Hundred Talents level of "National Hundred /Thousand /Ten Thousand Talents Project" and 9 young staffs are entitled "New Century Excellent Talents in University" by Ministy of Education. The ATM team is selected to be one of the "Creative Research Groups of Ministry of Education".
		   </p>
		   <p>In the past five years, the ATM has obtained 185 research projects, including five "973" projects, eight "863" projects, 5 National R&amp;D development projects, 2 National Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars, 5 key projects and 43 projects of National Natural Science Funds of China, etc, with a total funding of ~50 million RMB yuan or ~10 million Yuan per year. 8 textbooks and monographs and over 700 peer-reviewed papers have been published in the past 5 years, in which more than 300 and 450 papers are indexed by SCI and EI databases, respectively. 52 national invention patents are in publicity and 23 patents of them have been granted. 5 R&amp;D achievements at the national, provincial and ministerial levels have been awarded. 30 technologies have been applied in industry. The research progresses in several fields were made, including: (1) The analytical methods of texture and microstructure by neutron diffraction and synchrotron radiation；(2) The solid-state transformation mechanism, texture and microstructure control technology under multi-field coupling conditions; (3) The strengthening mechanism and texture control technology of aluminum alloy for automobile application；(4) The phase diagram, phase transition and the short process of forming process；(5) The orientation-related phase transition and function characteristics of ferromagnetic shape memory alloys；(6) The texture control and industrial technology of anisotropic materials (silicon steels, IF steels)；(7) The design of low-dimensional materials, the control of anisotropic growth, the self-assembly behavior and physical / chemical properties；(8) Design and preparation of visible-light-responding films, etc.</p>

		   <p>The cultivation of high-level talents are promoted by high level of scientific research, the recruitment of foreign high-quality intellectual resources and the international cooperation. Currently, around 130 students per year are trained in the ATM for their Master degree, doctoral degree or as postdoctoral researchers. One of them won the "National Top 100 Doctoral Dissertations Award" in 2007.</p>
		   　　　
		   <p>The infrastructure construction and research equipment of ATM are funding by "985" and "211" Projects, local governments and our university. The ATM owns more than 8000 square meters of the experimental space, and establishs the state-of-the-art experimental platform for material preparation, characterization and property testing. The total value of the equipment is more than 50 million RMB yuan. Some joint laboraries are established with domestic and foreign well-known instrument companies. </p>

		   <p>So far, the ATM has established extensive academic exchange and collaboration with the domestic and foreign universities, research institutes and industry, for example, Tohoku University (Japan), Metz University (France), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (USA), Argonne National Laboratory　(USA), University of Tennessee (USA), Institute of Metal Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Central South University, Bao Steel, Benxi Steel Group, Northeast Light Alloy Co., Ltd, Southwest Aluminum Co. Ltd., etc.</p>

		   <p>The ATM laboratory has gradually become a high-level research base, where can undertake national key science and technology programs, cultivate the high-level talents, such as the winners of National Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars and National Top 100 Doctoral Dissertations Award, carry out substantial international academic exchange and cooperation.</p>
