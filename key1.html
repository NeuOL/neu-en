								  <p>Motivated from urgent and practical needs of integrated automation in industrial enterprises, and aimed to achieve international forefront of the subjects, the main work of our laboratory focuses on the following aspects:</p>
								  <p>
								   i. Researches of new theories, new methods and new technologies on industrial process integrated automation whose objective is to optimize the enterprise production targets and flatness of the management, have been studied.  On this aspect, a number of original results which own international influence impact are achieved to promote the development of automation subject of China, eventually to put our country into the internationally advanced level in the field.</p>
								  <p>ii. Application researches on complex industrial processes, e.g. iron and steel, nonferrous metals, mineral processing, and etc have been studied.  On this aspect, application demonstrations in the process industries which incorporate integrated automation technologies to achieve remarkable energy saving results have been established.
								 </p>

								  <p>iii. A creative team which engages in combining the basic theory and application research researches on integrated automation of process industries has been established. The lab is built to be a creative base which converges and trains talents at home and abroad who engage in automation research in process industries. This base will eventually provide scientific and technical support to achieve green and automation of process industries in China.</p>
								  <p>Up to now, in our laboratory, a research team in reasonable structure, whose members own the abilities of certain originality and theory with practice, with the stability of the international advanced level in the integration of process control application of basic and applied technology has been established. This team is mainly composed of the Academy of Sciences, the Cheung Kong Scholars, the National Outstanding youth, the new Century Talents as the academic leaders or academic backbone of the research teams and institutions of Elite Overseas Experts (111 Project). In our lab, 50 permanent staffs, 25 PhD supervisors, 2 professors, 6 associate professors, 10 lecturers, 1 assistant are participated. Among these staffs, participate in participate in 43 of the overall are doctorate recipients, and the number of teachers under age 45 accounts for 59.1% of the total number of researchers.participate in</p>
								  <p>In the past five years, the laboratory had undertaken more than 200 longitudinal research projects with a total funding of 182.88 million yuan, including 2 national 973 projects, 69 National Natural Science Foundation project (2 Innovative Research Group project, 4 Outstanding Youth Fund projects, 5 key projects, 2 Overseas Outstanding Youth Fund projects, 1 major international cooperation project, 1 Overseas cooperation project), 1 national talent from overseas projects, 18 national 863 projects (5 key projects),  and 1 national support project.  In addition, the laboratory has the ability in undertaking major automation projects in enterprises. A total of 194 projects with a total funding of 190.88 million yuan are undertaken between 2005 and 2010 in major enterprises, offshore large-scale automation of scientific and technological projects, e.g., commitment to Papua New Guinea Ramu nickel and cobalt automation system (23.6 million yuan), Vietnam alumina production process control and management system (49.8 million yuan), as well as some domestic large-scale projects, such as China Aluminum Henan branch 70 million tons of alumina production line automatic control system (29 million yuan), a large clinker burning rotary kiln automatic control technology development, promotion and application (13.37 million yuan), pipeline leak detection acoustic sensor technology research and development (10 million yuan).</p>
								  <p>Up to the year of 2010, the lab has won a series of science and technology awards, including 3 National Technology Invention awards, 5 National Science and Technology Progress awards, 1 National Natural Science third prize, 15 principal or the first awards of the provincial and ministerial level, 16 second awards of the provincial and ministerial level. In addition, 1 Control Outstanding Industrial Achievement award by the IEEE Control Systems Society is achieved. Personnel from our lab have presented 25 International plenary lectures since 2005, particularly more than 10 times plenary lectures in the famous IFAC and IEEE series of international conferences held in the United States, Japan, Britain, Canada, Mexico and other countries, which won widespread international concerns and highly valued. Researchers of our lab have published a total of 816 papers, in which more than 200 SCI papers and 685 EI papers. Among the papers, over 60 are published in the famous journals of international control theory and control technology, e.g., IEEE Trans. on the Automatic Control, Automatica, the IEEE the Trans. on Control System Technology, Control Engineering Practice, and other IEEE transaction journals, including 28 regular papers, SCI cited 1500 times or more. 19 monographs (including 5 monographs in English) are published. 69 patents are granted, including 37 invention patents, 2 foreign patents, 22 software copyrights ones and 9 utility models ones, with additional 74 ones being processed.</p>
								  <p>The research results in the lab have been invited to do the plenary lectures in more than 10 international congresses, where widespread interest and highly evaluation have been aroused. In the 2007 IEEE multi-conference on systems and control held in Singapore, the result of the lab won the Outstanding Industrial Achievement Award (IEEE Control Systems Society) and was invited to do a one hour plenary lecture. The lecture is highly praised by the IEEE Control System Society former president, Prof. John Baillieul, and the Awards Committee Chairman, Dr. Lalit K. Mestha: "The work owns China's unique characteristics, worthy of our attention", and "The work establishes a successful example for the world and control areas" respecitvely. The evaluations improve China's academic position in the field of international control.</p>
