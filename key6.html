								  <p>The Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education on Safe Mining of Deep Metal Mines was approved to start a period of the establishment in December 2011, and the construction proposal of the lab has been demonstrated by May 2012.
		   </p><p>The purpose of this lab is to study the fundamental science issues on the evolution mechanism, prediction and control involved in rock burst in the deep mining and high temperature heat disaster, to develop evaluation methodology of the stability in complex engineering rock mass and cataclysm processing in pregnant and evolution, to achieve controlling technique in cataclysm and mining technology with high productivity, which lead to form analysis and prediction system of the deep mining disaster with the mixed approaches in mining geology, deep rock mass mechanics and information science of the computer, to outline a design guide and basic theory in safe and effective mining technology for deep mining in China.
		   </p><p>Based on consolidate and develop national key discipline in mining engineering, to seek a breakthrough in the research field covered in mine engineering mechanics and safety technology and engineering, the first deep metal mine safety mining lab would be built. Making the key lab to become a cross-fusion-extend platform with the feature multi-disciplinary including mining engineering, engineering mechanics, geology engineering and mine safety technology and engineering, it would greatly promote a development in the mining engineering discipline. In the meantime, training and introduction high level talent and young academic staff in the construction of the lab, to create innovation research group with the core of Yangtze River Scholar and the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China, to build the experimental research and teaching system facilitated with full instrument and equipment. This key lab will become an education base for high quality talent with good style in study, consolidating foundation, high quality in science research, and strong ability in practice, which to meet the social development.
		   </p><p>Aiming at a series of critical issues such as complex and diverse in burring conditions of the ore-bodies in the case of deep mining in mental mine, high ground pressure induced large caving of roof and ground pressure dynamic disaster, based on mine geology, deep rock mechanics, mining engineering, mine system engineering, computer and information science, it shall be constructed that innovation platform of safe and effective mining in deep metal mine. Four research field in this key lab as follows:
		   </p><p>1. Study on the feature of geological condition and geological structure in deep metal ore deposit;
		   </p><p>2. Deep rock mass mechanics and dynamic regulation and control theory in ground pressure;
		   </p><p>3. Fundamental theory in deep mining and safe and effective mining technology;
		   </p><p>4. Risk monitor and evaluation system in the processing of deep mining;
		   </p><p>The research group have some advantages in rigour, innovative, age and reasonable knowledge, which consists of 24 academic staff, among of them, 2 Yangtze River Scholar and the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China, 2 staff who were selected for New Century Talents Project, 4 staff in the Program for New Century Excellent Talents of Ministry of Education, 15 professors, 4 associated professors, 1 senior engineer and 4 lectures.
		   </p><p>The mining engineering and safe engineering disciplines involved in the key lab has been approved national outstanding subject in 2007 and 2010, respectively, which passed the qualified specialist in national engineering education. Mining has been awarded national classical course, 3 courses titled classical course in Liaoning province, 5 courses as university classical course, 2 first prizes in teaching achievement of Liaoning province. The above has supplied guarantee in training high quality talent.
		   </p><p>In recent years, proper extend the scale in training talent that result in a steady rise in quality of the training. At present, 3 doctoral-level discipline I in mine engineering, safe science and engineering and mechanics and doctoral-level discipline II in mineral resource prospecting and exploration. Mine engineering, surveying and mapping, geological resource and geological engineering, civil engineering and safe science and technology, 5 subjects are first grade discipline of master degree, the number of the enrollment research students in Master and PhD is relatively stable, 62 Master students and 30 PhD students in 2010, 80 Master students and 41 PhD students in 2011.
