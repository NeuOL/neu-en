                          Wen Bangchun, born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province on September 9, 1930, graduated from Northeast Institute of Technology(Northeastern University, 1993). Now Member of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS), Member of IFToMM (International Federation for the Promotion of the Mechanisms and Machine Science ) China Committee，Member of International Committee for Rotor Dynamics, Member of Asia-Pacific Vibration Conference Instruction Committee, Honorary President of the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society, Professor of School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation and Honorary Director of
                          Mechatronical Engineering Institute, Northeastern University, Honorary Director of Academic Committee of State Key Laboratory of Vibration, Shock &amp; Noise, Shanghai JiaoTong University. Professor Wen has been Member of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Member of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th Mechanical Engineering Subject Senate of the State Council's Academic Degrees Committee, President of the Chinese Vibration Engineering Society and Chief Editor of Journal of Vibration Engineering, and he has been or be Professor or Honorary Professor of more than 20 Universities. He was elected one of the first group of
                          Middle-aged and youthful experts in 1984 and Member of Chinese Academy of Science in 1991. And he received the Government Subsidy of State Council in the first batch in 1990.

                          <p>
                          Professor Wen first set up and developed the subject of vibration utilizing engineering in the world. He advanced the probability isometric-thickness screening, self-synchronization with deflecting exciter, dynamic analysis and parameters of nonlinear vibrational machinery, dynamic design method, theory of twice vibration isolation and corresponding computing method. Develop the theory of vibrational synchronization. He advanced the synchronization theory of self- synchronous vibration machine with planar motion and spacial motion, the synchronization theory of near-resonant self-synchronous vibration machine, theory and method of vibrational synchronized transmission, etc. He has published over 700 papers, indexed by SCI, EI and ISTP more than 260, in journals and conferences at home and abroad and over 33 monographs. He has been awarded the second prize of National Invention Award, the second prize of National Technology Progress, the third prizes of National Technology Progress (2 items), the international prizes (2 items), and the province or the MOST grade prizes (over 10 items), and achieved 8 national patents.As a doctoral supervisor, Professor Wen has supervised over 100 graduates, which includes 49 Ph.D students, 66 master degree students, 7 postdoctoral researchers and 2 foreign visit scholars. And now he is supervising 1 postdoctoral researcher, 84 Ph.D students and 107 master degree students.
