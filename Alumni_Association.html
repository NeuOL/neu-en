                    <h1>The Profile of Northeastern University Alumni Association</h1>
                    <div>
                       <p>Northeastern University attached great importance to alumni work when Zhang Xueliang acted as the president of NEU. Northeastern University, as a pioneer, founded Northeastern University Alumni Association on April 9, 1933. Since then, Northeastern University Alumni Association branches were set up in Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, etc. In 1934, the Nanjing Branch of Northeastern University Alumni Association founded. Headmaster and Marshal, Zhang Xueliang attended the founding meeting and delivered a speech to more than 50 alumni who worked in Nanjing. He expressed best wishes to them and hoped that they would never forget their hometown and Northeastern University.

                        </p><p>In the early 1960s, about 500 Northeastern University alumni of Taiwan established Northeastern University Alumni Association Branch in Taiwan. They strengthened the connections between Taiwan and the mainland and boost the unification of the motherland. During the mid '80s, Northeastern University Alumni Association branches were established in Beijing, Shenyang, Changchun, Dalian and America. Old university friends did a lot of jobs and contributed to the rehabilitation of the name of Northeastern University.
                        </p><p>Founded in August, 1993, Northeastern University Alumni Association was among the first to register in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After nearly twenty years of development, Northeastern University set up more than 80 Northeastern University Alumni Association branches at home and abroad, such as in America, Britain, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and other countries and regions.
                        </p><p>Northeastern University alumni played a strategic role in the process of the construction of a modern university in the new period and achieved a great success. In 2008, Northeastern University Alumni Association was credited as 'Excellent National University Alumni Unit' by the Alumni Research Branch of China Association of Higher Education. In 2009, Northeastern University Alumni magazine was rated as ' Excellent National University Alumni Periodicals'. In 2012, Northeastern University Alumni Association assumed the office of the standing director member of the Alumni Research Branch of China Association of Higher Education.
                        </p><p>Northeastern University Alumni Association kept a close relationship with the alumni at home and abroad, carried on the glorious tradition, promoted patriotism and adhered to the tenet: 'to serve alumni, to serve the units of the alumni, to serve NEU'. It strengthened the ties between the Northeastern University and its alumni, served its alumni wholeheartedly, propagandized Northeastern University and expanded the influence of Northeastern University domestically and overseas. Furthermore, it made full use of the strength of scientific and technological talent and made a great contribution to the local economical construction and social development.
