                    <h1>Brief Introduction on Northeastern University External Liaison and Cooperation Department</h1>
                    <div>
                    <p>In order to strengthen the strategic planning and the comprehensive promotion of university-society cooperation and further promote the opening up of Northeastern University, the previous Northeastern University Alumni Association, Board of Trustees and Peter H. L. Chang Education Foundation Office was restructured as Northeastern University External Liaison and Cooperation Department (Northeastern University Alumni Association, Board of Trustees and Peter H. L. Chang Education Foundation Office) in June, 2015. </p>
                    <p>Northeastern University External Liaison and Cooperation Department focuses on promoting the cooperation between the university and local communities, expanding educational resources and raising funds to support the development of the university. As a bridge between the university and local communities, it aims at promoting the university’s collaboration with government, enterprises, research institutions and social organizations so as to strengthen the tie with overseas alumni and trustees, guiding and promoting the development of the alumni association and expanding the social educational resources. </p>
                    <p>Northeastern University External Liaison and Cooperation Department will continue to play the role as the Alumni Association, Board of Trustees and Peter H.L Chang Education Foundation, providing strong support to the development of the regions and organizations where the alumni live and work so as to ensure a communication platform for the Alumni and Northeastern University. Through deliberation and consultation with the Board of Trustees and the Alumni Association on major strategy and policy resolutions with regard to the university’s development, the Alumni are encouraged to participate in development activities of the university. The Peter H.L Chang Education Foundation is responsible for the management of social donations, the establishment of fund-raising mechanism and the planning of fund-raising projects, comprehensively supporting the development of various undertakings at Northeastern University. </p>
