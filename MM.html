                       <p>
Founded on October 1996, the School of Materials and Metallurgy (SMM), Northeastern University, was established by the former departments of Ferrous Metallurgy, Nonferrous Metallurgy, Materials Science and Engineering, Metal Processing and Thermal Engineering. It is the first secondary school that integrates material, metallurgy, thermal energy engineering, environmental science and other modern and traditional industrial science. Yet its history can be traced back to the Department of Mining and Metallurgy of Northeastern University established in 1923.                        </p>
                       <p>
The older generation of scientists headed by Jin Shuliang, Ma Longxiang and Qiu Zhuxian laid a solid foundation for the development of SMM; outstanding talents are emerging in multitude from our graduates, such as Academicians Zuo Tieyong, Zhou Lian, Gan Yong, Zhang Yi, Luo Jianbin, Yu Aibing, Lu Gaoqing etc.; the first national "SEP Key Laboratory on Eco-Industry" was established on the basis of industrial ecology by Academician Lu Zhongwu; "the State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation" gave birth to an innovative team at the core of Academician Wang Guodong. The key program of "985 project", brings about a new "opportunity and challenge" to the development of SMM.                       </p>
                       <p>
Within the disciplines of SMM, there are 6 academicians of Chinese Academy of Engineering (including 2 specially-appointed and 1 dual-appointed academicians) and 2 members of the Discipline Evaluation Board of the State Council. Among the current faculty body of 249, there are 178 professional teachers (including 56 professors and 41 doctor supervisors), 1 special professor of the Yangtze River Scholar program, 6 obtainers of National Outstanding Youth Funds of Science (including 2 overseas outstanding youth) and 15 teachers admitted to Trans-/New Century Excellent Talents Plan of Ministry of Education. We have set up 8 basic academic units, and 20 key labs and research centers at the national, provincial and ministerial level, among which there is 1 national key lab, 3 key labs of Ministry of Education, 1 key lab of State Environmental Protection Department, 1 research base of State Engineering Center, and 3 engineering centers of Ministry of Education.                        </p>
                       <p>
There are 3 first-level disciplines authorized to confer doctor's degree, 17 second-level disciplines authorized to confer doctor's degrees, 11 second-level disciplines authorized to confer master's degrees and 3 postdoctoral research stations. The disciplines of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering are defined as first-class National Key Discipline, which cover 3 second-class disciplines. There are 2 first-class and 3 second-class Liaoning provincial key disciplines. SMM has 8 undergraduate programs including Metallurgical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Materials Forming and Controlling Engineering, Thermal Energy and Power Engineering, Environmental Science, New Energy Science and Engineering, Resources Recycling Science and Engineering, and Functional Materials. At present, there are over 2500 undergraduates, 900 graduates, 700 doctoral students, and 300 masters of engineering.                       </p>
                       <p>
By taking talents cultivation as the fundamental task, SMM is continuously seeking its way to improve education quality at all levels. Under the goal of "enhance foundation, widen major, buildup ability and heighten quality", SMM actively explores and successfully completes the curriculum reform of "Broad Material" and "Broad Metallurgy".                        </p>
                       <p>
SMM attaches great importance to the cooperation research with the national key fundamental projects, new and high-tech projects and enterprises. Since the "Ninth five year", the discipline group of Materials and Metallurgy has undertaken above 1000 research projects supported by "national 973 Program", "National 863 Program", and National Natural Science Foundation of China. Among the completed projects, 18 awards including first-class National Science and Technology Progress Award, second-class National Invention Award and over 170 provincial and ministerial awards have been obtained. Besides, over 9000 papers and 140 monographs have been published both at home and abroad, and 400 national invention patents have been granted.                       </p>
                       <p>
SMM actively promotes international cooperation and exchange programs, and has set up close partnership with over 20 universities and institutes from US, Japan, UK, France, Australia, and Russia. We have invited over 100 famous scholars at home and abroad as honorary or part-time professors of our school. Under "3+2" talent fostering mode, SMM has established the cross-school double major project for undergraduate students with the University of New South Wales in Australia. Besides, "Experimental Class for integration of undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students" co-built with the Institute of Metal Research, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has pioneered the cooperation between high-level universities and science and research institutes.                       </p>
                       <p>
Guided by the motto of "generous and realistic, promoting originality and practicing", and the spirit of "responsibility, confidence, courage and insight, and struggle", SMM aims to create a "nationally first-class, internationally renowned" research-oriented school and makes unremitting efforts to achieve this goal.                       </p>
