                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                              <p>Aiming to solve the key problems related to metallurgy and high-efficient utilization of metallurgical resources, Liaoning provincial key laboratory of metallurgical resources recycling science was established in 2011 with approval by the Education Department of Liaoning province. The laboratory is based on Department of Resources and Environment, doctoral discipline of metallurgical resources and ecological environment, doctoral, master and bachelor disciplines of resources recycling science and technology in Northeastern University.</p>
                              <p>In view of the features of the metallurgical resources as well as related environment in China, the following six aspects have been the lab’s important investigation areas to realize recycling utilization of metallurgical resources: high-efficient separation of special refractory metallurgical resources; high-efficient reutilization of metallurgical resources; regenerative utilization of solid wastes, resources and environment microorganism technology; preparation of ecological environment materials; environmental pollution control; etc. From an overall and coordinated consideration of metallurgical resources mining, processing andecological environment problems, the concept of ecological recycling utilization of the metallurgical resources is improving the governance from "the sources" to realize high-efficient recycling utilization of metallurgical resources and reduce pollutant emissions, which contributes to the technical progress of related industry and sustainable development of the national economy in our country.</p>
                              <p>Since the establishment of the key laboratory, many great achievements have been made including the new theoretical researches on resources and environment, comprehensive utilization technology development and innovative talents cultivation. The overall strength of resources recycling science and technology in Northeastern University, as a national strategic emerging industry discipline, has been enhanced, which can provide a strong support and guarantee for the national and regional economic development and technological progress.</p>
                              <p>There are 31 researchers working in the key laboratory including 10 professors and 15 associate professors or senior engineers. Additionally, there are 35 doctoral students and 62 master students conducting their research. In recent years, more than 30 national projects have been accomplished or are being implemented in the key laboratory, respectively sourced from Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) and National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program), The faculty have published more than 350 academic papers and applied 37 national invention patents.</p>
