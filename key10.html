						  <div>
                              <p>The Liaoning Key Lab of Big Data Management and Analysis was approved and established in September 2014.</p>
                              <p>The Key Lab affiliated to the Computer Science discipline of Northeastern University, which is the key construction discipline of 211 as well as 985 project of Chinese government. The discipline includes an innovative research team, which is made up of a group of outstanding young teachers with doctorate degrees and working experience in other countries. The Laboratory has 34 scientific researchers, of which more than 25 associate professors (5 doctoral tutors included), 22 of them are under the age of 45, and over 85% of them have a doctorate degree. Among the members of the team, one is serving as the panel members of National Natural Science Foundation of China, one obtained the Ministry of education “Yangtze River Scholar Award Program” distinguished professor, one obtained national outstanding youth science fund project, one obtained the national outstanding youth science fund project, 3 of the team members has got the Ministry of education in the New Century Excellent Talents funding, 11 young teachers obtained the National Natural Science Foundation of Youth Science Fund sponsored.</p>
                              <p>The Key Lab is built in Liaoning, with influence all over the country in the research of big data management and data analysis. Focusing on the capture of a number of key technologies, the Laboratory will promote the regional economic and industrial upgrading of Liaoning Province, as well as improving the overall technical level of our province. Meanwhile, it will also enhance the market competitiveness and technological innovation ability of key industries.</p>
                              <p>Developing and strengthening some of the advantages and characteristics of the subject direction, constructing high quality personnel training to improve the scientific research strength, as well as leveling up the computer science discipline of Northeastern University are another purpose of founding the Key Lab. It will also form as the leading factor for advanced level domestic and international development. The main research directions of Key Lab include:<br />
                              1. Cloud Computing Platform, including (1) Virtual machine deployment (2) Dynamic migration (3) Resource dynamic optimization (4) Resource Monitoring;<br />
                              2. Big Data Storage, including (1) Big data storage model (2) Big data copy management (3) Big data consistency maintenance (4) Load balancing for distributed storage system;<br />
                              3. Big Data Management, including (1) Distributed computing model (2) Distributed index (3) Distributed query processing and optimization;<br />
                              4. Big Data Analysis, including (1) Big data OLAP analysis (2) Big data mining (3) Multi-task scheduling and optimization.</p>
                              <p>In recent years, the Key Lab undertakes nearly a hundred of all kinds of scientific research projects at various levels with a total funding of nearly 4000 million Yuan, such as the Cheung Kong Scholars Programme, National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars, National Outstanding Youth Science Foundation, National Natural Science Foundation, Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of China, National 973 Program, National 863 Program and National Natural Science Foundation of China. And published more than 350 academic papers, which including nearly 20 papers published in the Top international academic conferences and journals, such as SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, ICDM and TODS, TKDE, TPDS. The Key Lab won the second prize of National Science and Technology Progress awards, the first prize in Science and Technology Progress awards of Liaoning Province. Two Ph. D. students obtain the nominations of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China; one obtains Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of CCF, two get Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Liaoning Province and one gets nomination of Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Liaoning Province.</p>
