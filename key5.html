								  <p>Authorized by the Ministry of Education, the Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing (MIC) was established at the Northeastern University in January 2009, was approved with the feasibility of Construction Plan by Science and Technology Division of MOE in September in the same year, passed the completion acceptance and formally founded in April 2012.
		   </p><p>Affiliated to the discipline of Computer Application Technology (National second-level key discipline), the discipline of Computer Science and Technology and Biomedical Engineering(first-level discipline of Doctor's degree), and the National Engineering Research Center for Digital Medical Equipment, the laboratory belongs to the discipline of information science, which was accredited to be qualified to offer doctoral program and is one of the key construction laboratories of "Project 211"、"Project 985" in Northeastern University.
		   </p><p>Aiming at solving fundamental problems to applications in medical image computing, closely integrated the international development trend of this discipline and the requirements of national and regional economic growth, MIC's research focus on four directions: reconstruction optimization &amp; visualization of medical image, processing and analysis of medical image, retrieval &amp; mining of medical information, computing environment of medical information. MIC strengthens the basic research and applied technology development and have made a number of important innovation and application of research results. Since the construction project is approved, MIC has undertaken and accomplished 25 research projects, of which 15 are national projects, including 2 National 863 Program, 2 National Science and Technology Support Program, and 9 National Natural Science Foundation. MIC has published 146 papers, in which about 24 are published in SCI/EI cited journals and 102 EI cited. In addition, 2 academic monographs have been published, 20 patents accepted with 6 patents authorized, the awards received including the Science and Technology Progress Award by MOE, and the Science and Technology Progress Award by Shenyang Municipal.
		   </p><p>The researchers of the laboratory pay a lot of attention to the application of the research results. Many prototype systems have been developed to help the clinical diagnosis, by means of cooperation with the companies and medical organizations. Currently, lung function analysis and DSA nerve silhouette prototype system have been developed by our researchers, which were integrated into the latest 64-slice CT scanner system of the Neusoft Medical Systems Co., Ltd. Furthermore, the semantic search engine prototype system of electronic medical records has been integrated into the Clinical data warehouse system developed by Neusoft Corporation, which has been widely used in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University and Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
		   </p><p>A high academic level and age structure, wide vision, a strong sense of responsibility, innovative academic echelon has been established by actively training and attracting talents, promoting innovation team in MIC. The faculty of the laboratory consists of 55 full-time researchers, among whom there are 15 professors. And 82.4％ of researchers are young and middle-aged scientific researchers under 50 years. The young and middle-aged academic leaders and academic backbone are the main force for the construction and development of the laboratory.
		   </p><p>The laboratory adheres to promote the cultivation of high-level professionals with distinctive subject characteristics and the high level of research. The graduate education of the laboratory keep international standard with joint training of graduate students. In recent years, there are 186 master graduates and 18 Ph.D. graduates, 8 of which have been selected to go abroad for joint training with the high-level research institutions. MIC continues to broaden the channels of cooperation, strengthen cooperation and exchange with domestic and foreign well-known academic institutions and enterprises, and spares no efforts in expanding the laboratory academic influence at home and abroad. MIC has selected 6 researchers, 6 graduates to go abroad and invited nearly 20 foreign experts to give lectures.
		   </p><p>MIC has built up a strong partnership with a number of renowned universities and institutes, including Duke University, Stony Brook University in New York, University of Pennsylvania, Technical University of Eindhoven, Gifu University in Japan and University of Alberta in Canada.
		   </p><p>The laboratory has carried out scientific research cooperation and shared the major research national and corporate tasks with domestic universities, hospitals and corporation such as Capital Medical University, Southern Medical University, Fourth Military Medical University, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Xuanwu Hospital, Neusoft Medical Systems Co., Ltd. and Neusoft Corporation.</p>
