					<div>
                       <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:-10px;">Project 211</h3>
                       <p>"Project 211" is the Chinese government's new endeavor aimed at strengthening about 100 institutions of higher education and key disciplinary areas as national priority for the 21st century. It is the largest and highest-level key construction project in tertiary education initiated by the government. The implementation of "Project 211" is an important measure by the government to rejuvenate the country through science and education, and is a visionary and crucial decision of China in face of the situation at the turn of the 21st century both home and abroad.
						</p><p>This project shall construct around 100 institutions of higher learning in a number of key disciplines to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It is envisaged that after several years' efforts, some 100 institutions of higher education and key disciplinary areas will have greatly improved their quality of education, scientific research, management and institutional efficiency. In addition, these institutions will also make remarkable progress in reforming the management system and consequently become the bases for training high-level professional manpower and solving major problems for the country's economic construction and social development. The project was formally launched in 1995 after having been approved by the State Council.
						</p><p>In 1996, Northeastern University was enrolled in the first group of "Project 211" key construction universities. Through the construction of "Project 211", the competitiveness of key disciplines in NEU has been gradually strengthened, and certain research directions have reached or been closer to international advanced level. The school has educated and introduced a group of leading academic and young and middle-aged academic cadres, and formed a rationally structured, capable and efficient, dedicated and innovative facility. With the innovative personnel training system generally in shape, NEU has provided the country with a large number of urgently needed personnel with strong innovative capacity. In addition, further improvement in resource sharing and formation of public service platform within the school have laid a solid foundation for developing NEU into a "first-rate in China and internationally renowned" high-level research university. Thus, NEU is bound to play a leading role in the new industrialization in China.
						</p>
										<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:-10px;">Project 985</h3>
										<p>"Project 985" is a constructive project for founding world-class universities in the 21st century conducted by the government of People's Republic of China. On May 4, 1998, President Jiang Ze-min declared at the 100th anniversary celebration of Peking University that "China must have a number of first-rate universities of international advanced level." On December 24, 1998, Ministry of Education released "Education Revitalization Action Plan for the 21st Century" and decided to focus on supporting some universities to create world-class universities and first-rate disciplines. On January 13th, 1999, the State Council approved the Plan and "Project 985" was formally launched.
						</p><p>"Project 985" aims to construct a number of internationally advanced disciplines and some world-class universities by the year 2020 or so; push some universities to leap forward in terms of overall level and international influence, and become internationally renowned high-level research universities; and build some high-level research universities with distinctive characteristics.
						</p><p>In December 2001, the Ministry of Education, Liaoning Provincial Government and Shenyang Municipal Government decided to jointly support the development of NEU. In January 2002, the joint construction agreement was signed, which marked NEU had become one of the first batch key construction universities under "Project 985". Through the construction of "Project 985", NEU has greatly improved its discipline structure, with certain research directions having reached or been closer to international advanced level. It has formed an innovative personnel training system and provided the country with a large number of urgently needed personnel with strong innovative capacity. The school has educated and introduced a group of leading academic and young and middle-aged academic cadres, and cultivated many research teams with high academic level and strong innovative capacity. It has also significantly improved its independent innovation and social service capability, and obtained many innovative research results. With more in-depth international exchange and cooperation, the school's international reputation and influence have been greatly improved as well. At present, NEU is making steady progress towards the objective of    "first-rate in China and internationally renowned" high-level research university and it is bound to play a leading role in the new industrialization in China.
