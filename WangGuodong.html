                          <p>
Wang Guodong，born in Liaoning province in 1942. He Graduated from NEU in 1966, and received the master's degree in 1981. Then he became a teacher of NEU after his graduation. In 1989, he became a full professor. He was elected Academician of China Academy of Engineering in 2005.
                          </p><p>
He has been the director of the State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation (1996-2004). Now he is associate chairman of the Steel Rolling Institute of the Chinese Society for Metal, member of the Liaoning Society for Metal and Chinese materials Research Society. He was voted of the associate chairman of academy committee of the State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation in 2004.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          Professor Wang Guodong has pursued his studies on the theory, technic and automation of advanced metal steels. He has undertaken and finished many research projects of National 973 Basal Basic Research, National 863 High-tech Plan, National Natural Science Key Foundation， National Key Technology Plan.

                          <p>
                          In the study of super steels, he presented the idea of grain refinement appropriately and complex strengthening, with which prototype steels have been developed and 400 MPa class super steels have been successfully produced on the existing rolling mill and have been widely used in automobile and building industry, making great contributions to the development, production and application of new generation steels. With the guide of Professor Wang, the technologies of TMCP, microstructures and performances forecast and the auto-control during rolling have been integrated and developed at the State Key Lab of Rolling and Automation (RAL), enabling advanced plate rolling mill to be made in china. These technologies have been applied in many steel companies and evident economy benefit has been achieved. In addition, Professor Wang has contributed a lot in the intelligence optimizing during rolling.

                          <p>
                          His research achievements were awarded two National Science and Technology Progress one-class Prizes, two National Science and Technology Progress second-class Prizes, thirteen top or second Science and Technology Progress Prizes of Ministry or Province. He has declared or authorized invented 14 patents, including 5 items of authorized utility new pattern. He has published 6 monographs and translated 4 books; 80 of his papers were embodied by SCI and 150 were included by EI. He has supervised 86 doctors and 69 for master who have graduated already.
