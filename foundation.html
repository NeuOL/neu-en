                    <h1>Brief Introduction on H.L Chang Education Foundation</h1>
                    <div>
                    <p>As a great patriotic general of China, Chang Hsueh-Liang attached great importance to education throughout his life. Since the 1920s, he had donated a greater part of his family property to help poor children to get educated, founding the “Xinmin Primary School” and “Tongze Middle School” in many areas of Northeastern China. He had concurrently been the president of Northeastern University for eight years from 1928 to 1936, and later the honorary president and honorary chairman of the university council from 1993 to 2001.</p>
                    <p>In honor of Chang Hsueh-Liang’s historical contribution to the educational development in China and in order to uphold his spirit of “love our university, love our hometown, love our home country and human-beings”, NEU initiated H. L. Chang Education Foundation by mobilizing people both at home and abroad and by uniting Chang Hsueh-Liang’s family members, friends and people from all walks of life so as to support the educational development in China, especially the educational development of his life-long beloved NEU and to train more talents for the rejuvenation of China. </p>
                    <p>Approved by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, the H. L Chang Education Foundation was founded in Shenyang as a nationwide non-public foundation in 2006 with the foundation office set at NEU.</p>
                    <p>The funds are mainly voluntary donations from domestic and overseas organizations and individuals. The funds are used for introducing special talents, rewarding excellent students, conducting academic exchanges, improving educational conditions, aiding students in straitened circumstances and supporting projects which conform to the charter. The usage shall be completed through the services provided by the foundation according to the charter, respecting the donators’ willingness. </p>
                    <p>The establishment of H. L. Chang Education Foundation has attracted great attention and assistance from NEU’ s alumni and people with great vision both at home and abroad who make earnest efforts to promote public welfare and care about our national education. We sincerely welcome more attention and assistance to H. L. Chang Education Foundation from you!</p>
