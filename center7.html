                        <p>Research Center for science and technology and social of Northeastern university (2004) is founded on Institute of natural dialectics(1978) and institute of technology and society (1984), Prof.Chen Changshu and prof. Yuan Deyu are the founder of the 2 institutes. Research center is approved by the ministry of education for the Innovation Base of "science and technology and society (STS)" of philosophical and social sciences, professor Chen Fan is the chief director.</p>
                        <p>Northeastern university is the leader in research of "science and technology and society (STS)" among the institutes and higher schools in China. Combining with the engineering colleges and universities discipline characteristic at northeastern university in 1978, the research center took technology and society (TS) as the main research direction. The research center drew lessons from the Japanese techno-enabled research results, combined with China's reality through theoretical innovation, formed the characteristic theory of STS. In 1993, it set up the doctoral resarch direction of science and technology and society (STS) based on the doctoral programme of philosophy of science and technology, cultivated a group of senior talents who engaged in the STS theory research and management. In recent years, on the one hand, the research center pays attention to strengthen the STS theory and practical research, on the other hand, pays attention to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries. The research center for "science and technology and society (STS)" of northeastern university has higher domestic academic status.</p>
